# Effective dimension of machine learning models

In this repository, there are several folders containing code to reproduce the results/figures from 
the manuscript titled "Effective dimension of machine learning models" (arXiv: to be linked soon). All code was generated using Python v3.7 and PyTorch v1.3.1 which can be pip installed. We add an addiitonal function to the [NNGeometry](https://nngeometry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library and provide the recommended installation below. The details of the implementation are contained in the arXiv paper with an explanation of each folder's contents and installation here.

## Installation 
This project requires Python version 3.7 and above, as well as PyTorch v1.3.1 and NNGeometry. Installation of PyTorch and all dependencies, can be done using pip:

`$ python -m pip install torch==1.3.1`

And for NNGeometry, we recommend cloning the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/amyami187/nngeometry.git`
